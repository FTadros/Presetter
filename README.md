# EECS1021-Major

A system that would take potentiometer and button values and do certain things to my computer to open certain websites that I use often. I wrote this in Java script using mostly firmata4J and Java AWT. One limitation for this project, is having to open the java code to edit the preferences, as well as not knowing what each choice number on the OLED means for which websites are going to launch.
